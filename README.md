> One issue I ran into was that my site worked properly when I loaded it in chrome, but not when I loaded it in IE or Microsoft Edge. Please warn
students about this issue in the future because I didn't figure this out until after a consderable amount of time. I feel like overall the instructions
in the specification could be improved. There were parts that were rather vague that took a while to understand. Additionally, I think that there were 
a few parts where including a link to an online tutorial would help.
